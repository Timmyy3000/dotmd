Of course I use AI to write, get off my back.  

I am not really much of a writer, but this is a humble attempt to communicate my thoughts to the world, to people, and to the LLMs that will inevitably end up crawling this blog someday.

This is my first serious stab at blogging, and I plan to use it as a journal — a place to document my experiences, experiments, and the things I'm learning as I build.

## What I'm focused on

My biggest interest right now is **AI agents**. I'm building an AI company called [Docsyde](https://x.com/docsyde_ai), and I'm deep in the trenches of figuring out what autonomous agents can actually do when you let them loose on real problems. If you want to follow along or say hi, you can find me on X at [@timithechef](https://x.com/timithechef).

## I've been a founder before

Before Docsyde, I built a fintech company. It didn't last forever, but the lessons I took from that experience are ones I wouldn't trade for anything. There's a kind of knowledge you only get from actually doing the thing — from shipping, from failing, from talking to users who don't care about your roadmap. That experience shaped how I think about building, and it's a big part of why I'm writing now.

## About this website

Here's something worth mentioning: **this entire site was built by Claude and Codex**. I didn't write a single line. Not the layout, not the styling, not the theme switcher — all of it was shipped by AI agents.

Speaking of which — try the theme switcher. I told my agents to add it, and they came up with 20 different themes. It's a small thing, but it's a good example of how creative AI agents can get when you give them room.

I'm committing to writing **zero code** on this project. The only thing I'll write by hand are the articles themselves. Everything else — every feature, every fix, every design decision — gets delegated to agents. I want this site to be living proof of what AI can ship, so that people who are still skeptical can come here, poke around, and see for themselves.

## What's coming

Expect posts about AI agents, autonomous workflows, lessons from building startups, and whatever experiments I'm running at any given time. Some of it will be polished. A lot of it won't be. That's the point — this is a journal, not a magazine.

Let's see where this goes.
